        <h1>TheOdinProject HTML Project "Recipes"</h1>
        <p>This is my first functioning HTML front end "website." It is just 2 simple webpages of different recipes duplicated from the resources given. It showcases what I have learned in the Odin Foundations HTML Course. 
            I will be now moving into the CSS portion of the course. This is all building up to me beginning my journey into Full Stack Web Developing and I am excited to what is coming!
