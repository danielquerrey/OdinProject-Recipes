        <h2>Pan-Seared Steak</h2>
        <p>This Pan-Seared Steak has a garlic rosemary-infused butter that makes it taste steakhouse quality. You will be impressed at how easy it is to make the perfect steak - seared and caramelized on the outside, and so juicy inside.</p>
        
        <h3>Steak Ingredients</h3>
        <p>It really does not get any easier than this and you do not need much to make a lip-smacking good steak. We used 2 New York Strip Steaks (pictured below), each weighing 1 pound and 1 1/4″ thick. Keep in mind a thicker steak will take longer to cook through and a thinner steak will cook faster. </p>
        <p> Well-marbled steaks will give you the juiciest results. Our favorite steaks to cook on a skillet are:</p>
        <!-- Ingredients Here-->
        <ul>
            <li>New York Steak</li>
            <li><a href = "https://bit.ly/3a1iYhA" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer" >Top Sirloin Steak</a></li>

        </ul>
        
        <h3>How to Pan Sear Steaks: </h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Pat dry</strong> - use paper towels to pat the steaks dry to get a perfect sear and reduce oil splatter.</li>
            <li><strong>Season generously</strong> - just before cooking steaks, sprinkle both sides liberally with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li><strong>Preheat the pan</strong> - on medium and brush with oil. Using just 1/2 Tbsp oil reduces splatter.</li>
            <li><strong>Sear steaks</strong> - add steaks and sear each side 3-4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then use tongs to turn steaks on their sides and sear edges (1 min per edge).</li>
            <li><strong>Add butter and aromatics</strong> - melt in butter with quartered garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs. Tilt pan to spoon garlic butter over steaks and cook to your desired doneness (see chart below).</li>
            <li><strong>Remove steak</strong> and rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Pro Tip: </strong> <em>We prefer using a <a href = "https://amzn.to/2QZrfw1"  target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer">large cast-iron pan</a> for best heat conduction, but a large heavy stainless steel pan will also work.</em></p>


        <h3>Steak Doneness Temperature Chart: </h3>
        <p>A steaks internal temperature continues to rise as it rests, so remove steaks from the pan about 5-10 degrees before reaching your desired doneness. Use this chart to determine steak doneness when testing with an 
            <a href = "https://www.thermoworks.com/Thermapen-Mk4?tw=NK" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer">instant-read thermometer</a>
            .For example, if you desire a medium doneness steak, remove it from the pan at 145 degrees F and it should rise to 150-155˚F as it rests. The
            <a href = "https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/safe-food-handling/safe-minimum-internal-temperature-chart/ct_index" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer">USDA</a>
            recommends cooking steaks to at least 145 degrees. Read more
            <a href = "https://bit.ly/2y5p834" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer">beef safety tips here</a>
            . Use the following steak temperature chart. These numbers reflect the final temperature after resting 10 minutes.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Medium Rare (soft, dark pink inside): 145 degrees F</li>
            <li>Medium (soft, some pink inside): 160 degrees F</li>
            <li>Well Done (very firm, no pink inside): 170 degrees F</li>
        </ol>
